## 🕹️ Controls

Click-based controls have been implemented for easy, mouse-only interaction:

| Zone                                   | Action                   | Sync Behavior |
| -------------------------------------- | ------------------------ | ------------- |
| **Left Edge (≤ 87px)**                 | ⏪ Rewind 5 seconds       | ✅ Synced      |
| **Right Edge (≥ screen width − 87px)** | ⏩ Skip forward 5 seconds | ✅ Synced      |
| **Center (±75px from center)**         | ⎯️ Toggle Play / Pause   | ✅ Synced      |
| **Between Left Edge and Center**       | 🔈 Decrease volume (5%)  | ❌ Local only  |

## 🌐 Hosting Tutorials

> ⚠️ All commands are run from Command Prompt (CMD).
> Ensure [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) is installed before proceeding.
> Place `videos/`, `server.js`, and `index.html` in the same folder, e.g. `C:\YourFolder\`.

### 🔌 Option 1: LAN or Public IP (Direct Hosting)

1. Run `server.js` by opening CMD in your folder and typing:

   ```bash
   node server.js
   ```
2. Make sure port `3000` is open in your firewall/router.
3. Get your **public IP** from [https://whatismyipaddress.com](https://whatismyipaddress.com)
4. Access the video from another device at:

   ```
   http://<your-public-ip>:3000
   ```

   Or if on LAN:

   ```
   http://<your-local-ip>:3000
   ```

### 🌍 Option 2: Hamachi (Virtual LAN)

1. Download and install [LogMeIn Hamachi](https://vpn.net).
2. Create a network, have others join it.
3. Share your **Hamachi IP address** (shown in Hamachi).
4. Run `server.js`, then visit:

   ```
   http://<your-hamachi-ip>:3000
   ```

### 🚂 Option 3: Hosting on Render (Free Cloud Hosting)

1. Go to [Render](https://render.com).
2. Create a new project → Deploy from GitHub.
3. Connect your repository:
   [https://github.com/Lakunake/WebDisplays-Video-Player](https://github.com/Lakunake/WebDisplays-Video-Player)
4. Choose the "RENDER" branch
5. Set these scripts scripts to:

   ```json
   "start": "node server.js"
   "build": "npm install"
   ```
6. Deploy and access your video player via the Render-provided URL.

index.html              # The frontend video player
package.json            # This tells Node.js which dependencies to install and how to run the server
start.bat               # The start file, gives you the link of the server
config.txt              # Optional config file to customize server port, install behavior, and launch settings
